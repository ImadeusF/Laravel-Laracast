## 📘 About this Repo

This repository contains the result of my personal learning journey following the [Laracasts "Learn Laravel in 30 Days"](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11) series.  
It serves as a hands-on exploration of Laravel’s core features, best practices, and real-world project structure.

## 🚀 Goals

- Blade templating
- Eloquent ORM and relationships
- Migrations and seeders
- Authentication and authorization
- Form validation (Form Requests)
- Middleware and route groups
- Protection Guard and Policies

- Tailwind CSS integration

This project is intended as a **code sample** for recruiters or peers who want to evaluate my Laravel skills.

## 🔐 Note
This project does **not** include the `.env` file or sensitive data. It is not configured for deployment or production.
